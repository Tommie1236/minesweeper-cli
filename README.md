# Minesweeper-cli

#### NOTE: This is currently still under development and not fully functional yet.

This is exactly what the title says it is, play minesweeper in your terminal!.  
It only runs on linux for now due to limitations of curses, the ui library i use. feel free to make a pull request with a version for other os's if you want to.

## Running

Install python3.10 (or any later version) using `sudo apt install python3.10` (Debian based linux.)

To run this game use `python3 run.py` for now. You also need the folloing dependencies:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- termcolor (`pip install termcolor`)
- curses (should be included in the default python install)

I will add executables later when I have a fully functional version.
